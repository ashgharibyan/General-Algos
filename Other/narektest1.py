# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. 
# you can use the same number twice if it occurs twice.
# Example:
# Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
# Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
# return [0, 1].


0:2
1:7
2:11
3:15

0: 9-2 = 7
